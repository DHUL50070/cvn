    <h2>FAQ:</h2>
    <p>Question: How do I apply for a job on CVN? </p>
    <p>Answer: We've got you! There is a google sheets to elaborate more on this topic, but I'll give you the basics. First, you must make an application at the last page of our Coronavirus News document. You must wait for your application to be accepted or denied. If it is denied, you must wait for a whole week before applying again. Please actually put effort in your application. Then, you must be trained. Finally, you must choose your position, and you are now a worker. </p>

    <p>Question: How do I get promoted? </p>
    <p>Answer: Promotions are near impossible in this company, but if you are very skilled in your job, you may be promoted head of your field. To be promoted to administrator, you must show proficiency in most of the fields, resolve many disputes, be fairly active on the document, and host at least 1 training per weeks (if there are interns, of course).</p>
